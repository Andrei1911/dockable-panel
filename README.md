# dockable-panel
Base code plus an example of dockable panel.


# How to use it:
1. Go to https://scriptui.joonas.me and create your UI(that one is not dockable).
2. Export that code and paste it to this base code, where it says //Paste code here
3. Replace window declaration with createDockableUI(this) and delete that line(row 23, we don't need that anymore).
4. Replace the last function argument with the name of your window.

You also have a file as an example. You can copy that to your After Effects ScriptUI folder and see how it works.

Suggestions and constructive criticism always welcomed.
